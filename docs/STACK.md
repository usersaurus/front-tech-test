# Stack

Just a list of used technologies, and why

- Apollo Client: for gathering planets and residents
- Radix UI: a component library I used all around the app
- Testing library: it's the most popular testing library afaik, so let's use it
- React Hook Form: as far as I saw is the cleaner solution for react forms I saw in a while.
- React Router: for managing our pages
- React Toastify: it's tiny, easy to use, clean and enough for showing the user some action feedback.
- uuid: for giving proper ids to our new planets
- yup: for the schema validation. It does a good team with React Hook Form
- zustand: our state management library. Since the API doesn't give us the tools for managing planets, we're doing the job there.
